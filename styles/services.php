                <p>Google 360 Virtual Tours take the technology of Google Street View inside the front door of your business. Google 360 Virtual Tours increase engagement by allowing a search engine user (also known as your potential customer) to see the interior of your storefront location(s). Just like any other business, Google appreciates and rewards those who use more of its offered products and services, meaning having a Google 360 Virtual Tour can help improve your search engine optimization (SEO) performance.</p>

                    <p>Search Engine Optimization…or SEO for short is the process of affecting the visibility and ranking of a website online. For the most part, websites are ranked and visible in the organic results of a search engine such as Google or Bing based on their content, message, responsiveness, etc. The listed factors that dictate page rank are too comprehensive and are often times misunderstood. One contributing factor are Google’s very own algorithms that change frequently and often times without notice. As a result, best practices for the industry are often ambiguous to the average user. Add analytics into the picture, coupled with the chaos of interpreting what those figures represent and you have a recipe for disaster to the untrained eye. We see this problem constantly and unfortunately SEO best practices are often times overlooked. This is where Clickit Social comes in. Our team of professionals are trained and equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to AMPLIFY your ONLINE PRESENCE! HERE ARE THE FACTS…. Did you know that 81% of shoppers conduct online research before making big purchases? Think about the last time you had to make a large purchase. With information readily available across the World Wide Web, you expect to be able to find it through a search engine to make informed decisions. Also consider that between 70% and 80% of users completely ignore paid advertisements, which makes SEO that much more important. ClickIt Social takes the confusion out of SEO for our clients, and ensures that they get the results they desire. Be sure to contact us today!</p>
