                    Google 360 Virtual Tours increase engagement by allowing a search engine user (also known as your potential
                    customer) to see the interior of your storefront location(s). Just like any other business, Google appreciates
                    and rewards those who use more of its offered products and services, meaning having a Google 360 Virtual
                    Tour can help improve your search engine optimization (SEO) performance.</p>

                    <p>Search Engine Optimization…or SEO for short is the process of affecting the visibility and ranking of a website
                        online. For the most part, websites are ranked and visible in the organic results of a search engine
                        such as Google or Bing based on their content, message, responsiveness, etc. The listed factors that
                        dictate page rank are too comprehensive and are often times misunderstood. One contributing factor are
                        Google’s very own algorithms that change frequently and often times without notice. As a result, best
                        practices for the industry are often ambiguous to the average user. Add analytics into the picture, coupled
                        with the chaos of interpreting what those figures represent and you have a recipe for disaster to the
                        untrained eye. We see this problem constantly and unfortunately SEO best practices are often times overlooked.
                        This is where Clickit Social comes in. Our team of professionals are trained and equipped with the skills
                        and knowledge necessary to AMPLIFY your ONLINE PRESENCE! HERE ARE THE FACTS…. Did you know that 81% of
                        shoppers conduct online research before making big purchases? Think about the last time you had to make

                        to find it through a search engine to make informed decisions. Also consider that between 70% and 80%
                        of users completely ignore paid advertisements, which makes SEO that much more important. ClickIt Social

                    <p>Why a logo? An excellent company logo invites new customers to take interest in your company with just a
                        glance. Interesting designs catch peoples attention and makes it hard to forget the name of your business.
                        Logos are also able to be placed everywhere and help make it easier to advertise your business in a more
                        efficent manner.</p>
